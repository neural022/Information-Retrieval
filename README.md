# Information-Retrieval
<!-- ## Project outline -->

## Definition
What is the **`information retrieval`** ?

> **The primary goal of the IR system is to retrieve information that is useful and relevant to the user's information needs.**

<br/>

Modeling in IR is divided into two parts:

1. **Representation**
     * It refers to represent queries and documents in logical framework concepts.
2. **Ranking**
      * It aims to allow quantify the similarities among queries and documents.

<br/>


**Index Term** (or called vocabulary / lexicon / dictionary)
  * A unit of a set of keywords for a query or doc.
  * Summarize the contents of the doc.
  
      > **Usually, an index term is a word or group of consecutive words in a document**.
